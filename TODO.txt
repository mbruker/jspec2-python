 
- The separation between Ions and Beam is not clear.
  It may be a good idea to keep immutable parameter sets and
  state representation separate in the class hierarchy, but
  these classes don't do that. Consider merging them.

- The thing with the dual force solver seems dirty.
  Is there a clean way?

- update_bet_s() exists in both Ions and Ring. Find out if
  this makes sense

- Can other_effects.cc be removed?
  
- Replace assertions by exceptions (and properly expose those to Python).
  Design all constructors and setters such that they will catch
  all user errors previously handled in the UI.

  grep for printf, perror, assert

- Export all generated data to Python
    - Ion phase space
    - Force curve?
    
- Clean up all PB files:
    - Remove unneeded methods
    - Named arguments, default values where applicable
    - Documentation

- The constants FrictionForceSolver::k_f and ForcePark::k_f have different values.
  Super dangerous! Can we rename one of them?

- Example files!

- Originally, Ions::center and Beam::center coexisted and were
  used in a few places, but NEITHER had any purpose.
  I have merged them into one, but of course, it still doesn't do anything
  as far as I can see. Maybe it is meant to be used in the future.
  Check that nothing is broken!
