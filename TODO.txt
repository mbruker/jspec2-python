 
- The separation between Ions and Beam is not clear.
  It may be a good idea to keep immutable parameter sets and
  state representation separate in the class hierarchy, but
  these classes don't do that. Consider merging them.

- The thing with the dual force solver seems dirty.
  Is there a clean way?

- update_bet_s() exists in both Ions and Ring. Find out if
  this makes sense

- Can other_effects.cc be removed?
  
- Replace assertions by exceptions (and properly expose those to Python).
  Design all constructors and setters such that they will catch
  all user errors previously handled in the UI.

- Export all generated data to Python
    - Ion phase space
    - Force curve?
    
- Clean up all PB files:
    - Remove unneeded methods
    - Named arguments, default values where applicable
    - Documentation

- Example files!
